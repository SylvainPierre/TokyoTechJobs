  ただコードを書くだけ、要望を実装するだけのエンジニアは求めていません。必ず「現状の問題は何か」「そのために最適な手段（技術）は何か」
といった議論の段階から参加してもらい、
つくるものの目的と手段を深く理解することで、
「納得感をもって働いてもらう」ことを大切にしています。<br><br>

とはいえまだまだまだ発展途上のチームであり、富士山で言えば1合目といったところでしょうか。
ですが未熟なチームだからこそ、一人ひとりがチームの未来について話す時間を大切にしており、
定期ミーティングでチームの方向性や開発フローの改善の取り組みを行っています。
私たちは、エンジニアが良質なアウトプットを生み出す環境に従事できる仕組みづくりを目指します。<br><br>

  【チームの雰囲気】<br>
  言いたいこと、言うべきことをしっかりと伝え、全体として「協力する」文化が根付いているチームです。<br>
  開発フローや業務の効率化など、チームが掲げる目標に対してチーム全員が主体的に行動し取り組んでいます。<br>
  ビジネスサイドも全員GitHubを使うなど、プロダクトサイドとビジネスサイドの距離がかなり近いのもシェルフィーの特徴です。<br>
  また(なぜか) ほとんどのメンバーが海外に住んでいた経験があるので、
  人間関係のフラットさや多様性を受入れることには自信があります。<br>
